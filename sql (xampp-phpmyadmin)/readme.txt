To import an SQL file in XAMPP, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL services if they are not already running.

2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. This will take you to the phpMyAdmin interface.

3. Click on the "Import" tab at the top of the phpMyAdmin page.

4. Click on the "Choose File" button and browse to the location where your SQL file is saved.

5. Select the SQL file and click the "Open" button.

6. Click the "Go" button to start the import process.

7. Wait for the import to complete. The time taken for the import process will depend on the size of the SQL file.

Once the import is complete, you should see a success message indicating that the SQL file was imported successfully. You can then use the imported database in your PHP applications or web projects.
